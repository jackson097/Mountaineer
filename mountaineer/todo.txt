To Do:

- Stefan figure your github out
- Put it all together (spinning sphere, character, falling objects, make objects smaller maybe?)
- Pause menu (Jackson)
- score shown as player plays, highscore stored while app is open (Noah)
- screen that shows up when game over, gives option to restart or quit
- make game get harder as time goes on
- figure out what axis we want him staying on when he moves
- make him fall off screen fast when he falls of mountain
- Textures (needs to be done by Noah or Stefan)
- Sounds (music and sounds when he dies)


Optional:
- Unlock characters when you reach a score
