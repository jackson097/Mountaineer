To Do:

- Stefan figure your github out
- Put it all together (spinning sphere, character, falling objects, make objects smaller maybe?) // <- mostly done by Noah, object size on the way
- Pause menu (Jackson)
- score shown as player plays, highscore stored while app is open (Noah)
- screen that shows up when game over, gives option to restart or quit
- make game get harder as time goes on // <- boulder speedup implemented, brainstorm other ways for difficulty and smooth out randomX() func.
- figure out what axis we want him staying on when he moves
- make him fall off screen fast when he falls of mountain //<= we could try to aim for the old-school mario death animation maybe?
- Textures (needs to be done by Noah or Stefan)
- Sounds (music and sounds when he dies)


Optional:
- Unlock characters when you reach a score
