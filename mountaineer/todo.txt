To Do:

- Textured mountain (Stefan)
- make him fall off screen fast when he falls of mountain //<- need to figure out a way to keep othe resources drawn for animation ( or do we want him to be restricted to the mountain and when he dies the death animation happens)
- Textures (needs to be done by Noah or Stefan)
- Make boulders textured
-beautify start menu
- can we make score slower?



Optional:
- Unlock characters when you reach a score
- Add a file that stores highscores <- moved from to-do to optional for now
- Scale character down in death animation while hes falling to death ( does it already do that? not sure)

Completed:
- Sounds (music and sounds when he dies) <- [COMPLETED] by stefan
- score shown as player plays, highscore stored while app is open (Noah) <- [COMPLETED]
- Pause menu, figure out how to resume game, figure out how to identify when the button (cube) is clicked (Jackson)
- Fixed & worded menuing (Jackson)
- Score reset when restart clicked, number of lives resets (if that's what we're doing) [COMPLETED] (Noah)
- smooth out randomX() func for boulders. <- [COMPLETED] (Noah)
- screen that shows up when game over, gives option to restart or quit <-has been set up, we really need game over menu to be finished  (Jackson)
