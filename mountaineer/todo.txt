To Do:

- Stefan figure your github out
- Put it all together (spinning sphere)
- Pause menu, button on game menu, stop and resume game, restart, quit (Jackson)
- score shown as player plays, highscore stored while app is open (Noah)
- screen that shows up when game over, gives option to restart or quit
- smooth out randomX() func for boulders.
- figure out what axis we want him staying on when he moves
- make him fall off screen fast when he falls of mountain //<= we could try to aim for the old-school mario death animation maybe?
- Textures (needs to be done by Noah or Stefan)
- Sounds (music and sounds when he dies)
- Add a file that stores highscores

Optional:
- Unlock characters when you reach a score
